This is a snapshot of the Xinu codebase for the 2nd edition of Comer's Operating System Design book. It was imported from https://xinu.cs.purdue.edu/files/Xinu-code-BeagleBoneBlack.tar.gz. The original version of Xinu from the ancient first version of Comer's book has so many forks at this point that it's hard to sort them out. But I couldn't find any copy of the code on GitHub for the recent second edition, which is a clean-slate implementation.
